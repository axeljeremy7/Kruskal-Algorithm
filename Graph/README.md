I implemented a map structure in which the id of the maps are hashcodes of the instances of the
objects vertex created and next part of the map  I create an list of Vertices objects that include Edges objects.
The first element of each list of the map help to identify each vertex of the graph and the left part of the list is to identify the adjacent vertices and edges at the same time.




I also create another ruby test but not with rspec features and this is something additionally but also
I use the rspec to test each class
